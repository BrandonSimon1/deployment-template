/*
 * This trigger is useful for adding realtime features to our GraphQL schema
 * with minimal effort in the database. It's a very generic trigger function;
 * you're intended to pass three arguments when you call it:
 *
 * 1. The "event" name to include, this is an arbitrary string.
 * 2. The "topic" template that we'll be publishing the event to. A `$1` in
 *    this may be added as a placeholder which will be replaced by the
 *    "subject" value.
 * 3. The "subject" column, we'll read the value of this column from the NEW
 *    (for insert/update) or OLD (for delete) record and include it in the
 *    event payload.
 *
 * A PostgreSQL `NOTIFY` will be issued to the topic (or "channel") generated
 * from arguments 2 and 3, the body of the notification will be a stringified
 * JSON object containing `event`, `sub` (the subject specified by argument 3)
 * and `id` (the record id).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     create trigger _500_gql_update
 *       after update on app_public.users
 *       for each row
 *       execute procedure app_public.tg__graphql_subscription(
 *         'userChanged', -- the "event" string, useful for the client to know what happened
 *         'graphql:user:$1', -- the "topic" the event will be published to, as a template
 *         'id' -- If specified, `$1` above will be replaced with NEW.id or OLD.id from the trigger.
 *       );
